_The one can achieve that much only because he is standing on somebody's shoulders._

This project would be impossible without contribution of many other fine developers and maintainers to a great many projects. And for those continuous efforts, often performed at there own free time, I salut them.

### Credits for the job without which this module would not exists at all:

1. [Python](http://www.python.org) - all code of  ZQ/ZQL is written in Python.
2. [Zabbix](http://www.zabbix.com) - thank you to all great developers and architects of Zabbix for a truly fine product. Without Zabbix, Zabbix Query Language is nonsence.
3. [Cython](http://www.cython.org) - Cython is the cornerstone of the ZQ/ZQL development. Everythong in ZQ/ZQL is compiled into a machine executable code.
4. [Hy Language](http://docs.hylang.org/en/latest/index.html) - Lisp inside a Python and it's threaded macros is the heart of the ZQL.
